        The Mine is our unique staking system where you invest your tokens to
        earn exclusive rewards. By staking, you increase your workforce and
        unlock higher tiers that provide better benefits such as more materials
        per hour, higher treasure chances, enhanced experience and Golden Uruks
        boosts, and increased export limits.

          <strong>Staking Tokens:</strong>
          <p>
            In The Mine, you stake your tokens to hire goblin workers and build
            your mining infrastructure. Your staked amount determines your tier
            and the rewards you receive.

            earn additional rewards.
