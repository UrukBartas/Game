        In the Bridge section, you can seamlessly export your in-game rewards to
        your external wallet. Golden Uruks earned during gameplay are
        automatically converted into ERC20 tokens and sent to your wallet, while
        your items are minted and exported as NFTs.

          <strong>Exporting Golden Uruks:</strong>
          <p>
            When you select the "Export" mode, your Golden Uruks are converted
            into ERC20 tokens. These tokens are transferred directly to your
            connected wallet, allowing you to manage, trade, or use them outside
            the game.

          <strong>Exporting Items as NFTs:</strong>
          <p>
            Choose the NFT export type to automatically mint your valuable
            in-game items as NFTs. This process creates a unique, on-chain
            record of your items, ensuring secure ownership and easy
            tradability.

          <strong>Import Mode:</strong>
          <p>
            You can toggle between Export and Import modes using the switch at
            the top. In Import mode, items or tokens are brought back into your
            game inventory automatically.
