        The Auction House is your in-game marketplace for trading items. Here,
        you can create new trades, view detailed listing information, filter and
        sort listings, and check bids. Let’s walk through the main functions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Creating a New Trade:</strong>
          <p>
            Click the <strong>"New Trade"</strong> button to open a modal where
            you can list your item for sale. This is your starting point for
            selling items in the marketplace.
          </p>
          <!-- Relevant Image: A screenshot of the "New Trade" button and modal -->
          <img
            class="pb-1"
            src="{{ prefix + '/assets/tutorials/3.png' }}"
            alt="New Trade Modal"
          />
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Viewing Listings:</strong>
          <p>
            Browse the market listings and click on any listing to view more
            details. This opens a modal displaying the item’s information,
            seller details, and current bid status.
          </p>
          <!-- Relevant Image: A screenshot of the listing details modal -->
          <img
            class="pb-1"
            src="{{ prefix + '/assets/tutorials/4.png' }}"
            alt="Listing Details"
          />
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Filtering and Searching:</strong>
          <p>
            Use the search box to find listings by name and apply filters such
            as minimum/maximum level, rarity, and status (e.g., Active, Sold,
            With bids, Bought). The left sidebar also offers preset filters for
            various item categories and subtypes.
          </p>
          <!-- Optional Image: A screenshot showing the filtering options -->
          <img

            src="{{ prefix + '/assets/tutorials/5.png' }}"
            alt="Auction Filters"
          />
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Sorting Listings:</strong>
          <p>
            Toggle between sorting by <strong>recent</strong> or
            <strong>price</strong> using the sort icon and label at the top of
            the listings. You can also change the sort order
            (ascending/descending) with a simple click.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Pagination:</strong>
          <p>
            Navigate through the pages of listings using the pagination controls
            at the bottom. This helps you quickly browse through a large number
            of items available in the market.
          </p>
        </li>
