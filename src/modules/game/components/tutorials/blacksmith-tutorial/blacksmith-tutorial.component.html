        In the Blacksmith, you can work on your items in various ways to improve
        or recycle them. Here are the main functions available:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Melt:</strong>
          <p>
            Break down unwanted items into magical dust, which can then be used
            as a resource for enhancements or upgrades. Use this option when you
            want to recycle items that no longer serve you.
          </p>
          <!-- Optional Image: A screenshot or illustration of the melting process -->
          <img
            class="pb-1"
            src="{{ prefix + '/assets/tutorials/14.png' }}"
            alt="Melt Items"
          />
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Repair:</strong>
          <p>
            Restore the durability of your items so they can perform optimally
            in battle. Repairing is crucial when your gear has been worn down by
            repeated combat.
          </p>
          <!-- Optional Image: A screenshot or illustration showing the repair process -->
          <img
            class="pb-1"
            src="{{ prefix + '/assets/tutorials/15.png' }}"
            alt="Repair Items"
          />
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Combine:</strong>
          <p>
            Fuse two or more items together in hopes of creating a more powerful
            or rare item. This option requires selecting at least two items to
            combine.
          </p>
          <!-- Optional Image: A visual example of items being combined -->
          <img
            class="pb-1"
            src="{{ prefix + '/assets/tutorials/16.png' }}"
            alt="Combine Items"
          />
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Upgrade:</strong>
          <p>
            Enhance an item's stats or quality by investing valuable resources.
            However, be cautious—if the item's durability is too low, it may
            break during the upgrade process.
          </p>
          <!-- Optional Image: A screenshot or graphic depicting an upgrade in progress -->
          <img
            class="pb-1"
            src="{{ prefix + '/assets/tutorials/17.png' }}"
            alt="Upgrade Items"
          />
        </li>
        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Enchant:</strong>
          <p>
            Apply unique enchantments to your items to boost their performance,
            attributes, or abilities. Enchanting adds special effects that can
            give you an edge in battle.
          </p>
          <!-- Optional Image: A visual showing the enchantment process -->
          <img
            class="pb-1"
            src="{{ prefix + '/assets/tutorials/18.png' }}"
            alt="Enchant Items"
          />
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mt-3">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Upgrading items carries a risk—if an item’s
        durability is insufficient, it may break during the process. Always
        check your item's condition before attempting an upgrade.
