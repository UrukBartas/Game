        This is a PvE section where you face all kinds of creatures to earn
        Golden Uruks, equippable items, materials, and more. The Quest System is
        your gateway to epic adventures. Depending on your progress, you’ll
        experience several phases: selecting a quest, tracking its progress,
        engaging in combat, and reviewing the results.

          <strong>Quest Picker:</strong>
          <p>
            In this phase, you choose your next quest from a list of available
            adventures. Each quest card displays key details such as the quest
            name, level requirement, description, and an estimated completion
            time.

          <strong>Quest Progress:</strong>
          <p>
            After selecting a quest, the progress view kicks in. A carousel
            displays the chosen quest’s background image, title, and detailed
            description. The screen features a progress bar that shows the
            remaining time, as well as any active boosts that reduce quest
            duration.

          <strong>Quest Fight:</strong>
          <p>
            For quests that involve combat, you transition into the fight phase.
            Here, you face your enemy—complete with details about its type and
            hints about its strengths and weaknesses. Engage in battle using
            your equipped items and abilities.
          </p>

        <li class="mb-3">
          <strong>Quest Result:</strong>
          <p>
            Upon completing the quest or battle, the result screen is displayed.
            Whether you’ve achieved victory or suffered defeat, you’ll see
            valuable information such as loot dropped, experience gained, Uruks
            earned, and level-up notifications. In some cases, you might even
            encounter a special “ganked” scenario.

        Embark on your quests, conquer challenges, and reap the rewards of your
        adventures. Good luck, brave adventurer!
